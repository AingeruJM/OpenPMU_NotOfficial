# OpenPMU
OpenPMU is the Open Source Phasor Measurement Unit.

What's a PMU?  Why do I want one?  Find out at www.openpmu.org/pmu-fundamentals  :)

We're presently migrating our project over from other repositories.  We're also tidying up our code to make it more friendly.

So please watch this space!  :)

We're also easy to get in touch with via facebook.com/OpenPMU - Say hi!  :D
