# OpenPMU V2 - XML Datagrams

The purpose of this document is to describe the XML datagram formats used within OpenPMU V2.  There are two main datagrams in use in OpenPMU:

* XML Sampled Values
* XML Phasor Values

## Overview

In OpenPMU V2, all aspects of the Phasor Measurement Unit data pipeline are rigidly modular.  The three important modules in the pipeline are:

* Data Acquisition (Usually an ADC, sometimes simulator or playback of recordings).
** Produces a stream of sampled values formatted in XML.
* Phasor Estimation (estimates phasors from sampled values).
** Produces a stream of phasors formatted in XML.
* Telecommunications (Usually an IEEE C37.118.2 or IEC 61850-90-5 adapter).
** Provides, for example, a TCP socket with which to connect by IEEE C37.118.2.

You can find a detailed description of OpenPMU's modular configuration and data flows in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8273986):

Although XML is traditionally used to markup data in files, in OpenPMU it is used to markup data in streams of UDP datagrams.  This makes the modules in OpenPMU completely plug and play, yielding a highly flexible system.

The next sections provide a brief description of the XML datagram structures intended to help developers working on the OpenPMU system.

## XML Sampled Values (SV) Datagram

An example of the datagram is given below.  The first section of the datagram contains important metadata describing the structure of the sampled values.  

* **Format** indicates that this datagram is a _Samples_ datagram.  This field is not required, but recommended.

* **Date** and **Time** refer to the time at which the first sampled value (SV) in each payload was taken.  Note: All channels are synchronously sampled, so sample 0 of Channel_0 was acquired at the same time as sample 0 of Channel_1, etc.  

* **Frame** is a sequence number which is useful to determine if frames of data have been dropped.  Normally, the frames are sent at a rate of 2x the nominal system frequency, so on a 50 Hz system the frame number increments from 0 to 99 and then loops to 0.  On a 60 Hz system, it loops between 0 and 119.

* **Fs** is the sampling rate / sample frequency of the ADC.  The period between sampled values (_Ts_) is given as _Ts = 1 / Fs_.  In this example, the sampling rate is 12,800 Hz, so the period is 78.125 Î¼s.  This means that sample 1 occurs at time 22:04:00.000078125, and sample 2 occurs at 22:04:00.00015625, and so on.

* **n** is the number of sampled values in each _Payload_.  Here there are 128 sampled values in each payload.  Multiplying _n_ by _Ts_ tells us that the payload represents 10 ms of waveform data.

* **bits** is the number of bits per sampled value.  In this case, 16 means that the sampled values are expressed as 16-bit signed integers.

* **Channels** is the number of channels of data contained in this datagram.  In this case, there are 3 channels.

Each channel is described as starting with a tag named **Channel_N** where _N_ starts at 0.  Within this tag there is metadata which is unique to that channel, and then the payload of sampled values.

* **Name** is the name of that channel.  Here the channel name is '_Belfast_Va_'.  This name is used to name the phasors produced by the phasor estimator, and ultimately by the Telecoms interface.

* **Type** states if the channel is a voltage channel '_V_' or a current channel '_I_'.

* **Phase** states which phase the channel represents.  This is useful when storing data from polyphase circuits as it avoids having to parse such information from the _Name_ tag, which might in the case of some end users may employ an esoteric naming convention.  Typically these are labelled '_a_', '_b_', '_c_', '_n_'.

* **Range** states the full scale deflection of the sampled values.  In the case of signed 16-bit integers, this means that a value of 32,768 equates to a voltage of 275 V.

* **Payload** the payload is the sampled values encoded in Base64.  The reason for this is to map the binary data to a set of ASCII characters so that the datagrams can be passed and parsed through virtually any data manipulation tool.  There is a trade off as it increases the size of the datagrams, but since these datagrams are intended for inter-module communication, often on the same localhost or devices in the same physical enclosure, this does not lead to any issues re bandwidth on external networks.

## XML Phasor Values (PV) Datagram

The structure of the phasor values datagram is largely similar to that of the sampled values datagram above.  Much of the metadata, particularly that describing the individual channels, is copied directly from the SV datagram.

* **Format** indicates that this datagram is a _Phasors_ datagram.

* **Date** and **Time** indicates the time at which the phasor estimations contained within the datagram are valid.  In this case, it is 460 ms past the top of the second.

* **Frame** is a sequence check.  This frame is Frame 23.  The number of frames will depend on the rate at which phasors are estimated.  If estimating at nominal frequecy, the _Frame_ number will loop between 0 and 49 (50 Hz systems) or 0 and 59 (60 Hz systems).  It is useful to check programmatically for missing data.

* **Algorithm** This is a free text field which is used to state the name of the algoritm in use.  This is useful for subsequently comparing / evaluating / debugging various algorithms against the same test conditions.

* **Channels** is the number of channels of data contained in this datagram.  In this case, there are 3 channels.

Each channel is described as starting with a tag named **Channel_N** where _N_ starts at 0.  Within this tag there is metadata which is unique to that channel, and then the phasor values estimated by the phasor estimation algorithm (from the sampled values).  Note that, usually, each phase is processed completely independently by the phasor estimator as if it had no knowledge of any of the other phases.

* **Name**, **Type**, **"Phase**, **Range** are usually copied directly from the SV datagram.

* **Mag** and **Angle** express the phasor value for that channel in polar form.

* **Freq** is the frequency estimated for that channel.  In IEEE C37.118.2, only one frequency is reported.  The Telecoms module will handle this, often by using the frequency of only one channel, or an average, or some other manner selected by the user.  In IEC 61850-90-5, frequency is reported for each channel.

* **ROCOF** is the rate-of-change-of-frequency estimated for that channel.  Note similar issue re onward telecoms as with _Freq_.
